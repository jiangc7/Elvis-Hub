## Assumptions and Design Decisions

### 1. Route Design

The site's routes are divided into two main endpoints:
- `/`: The main entry point of the website.
- `/api`: Connects to the backend FastAPI service at [www.elvisjiang.com/api/docs](https://www.elvisjiang.com/api/docs).

### 2. Page Design

Detailed information about the design of the website's pages and user interface can be found here.
